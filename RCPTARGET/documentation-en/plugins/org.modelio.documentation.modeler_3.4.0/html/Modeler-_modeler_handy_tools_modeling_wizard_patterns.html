<p>Modeling assistants enable you to significantly improve productivity, coherence and traceability, by creating elements from other elements through
deduction.</p>

<p>For example, from an object present in a sequence diagram, you can create a class whose operations will be deduced directly from the messages received by the object.</p>

<p>Modeling assistants are run from the &ldquo;Modeler Module&rdquo; item in the context menus available on certain elements in the &ldquo;Model&rdquo; view and Modelio
diagrams.</p>

<p>The following list shows which Modeling assistants are available on which model elements.</p>

<p><strong><ins>Instance</ins></strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Create a classifier from this instance</strong>: Creation of a classifier and its contents from the instance and the received operations. If the instance has ports, the element created can be a class or a component. Otherwise, it can also be an interface or a node.</li>
<li><strong>Update instance or part from the classifier</strong>: Updates the ports and attribute links of the instance with regard to the instanciated classifier. If the instance is not linked to a classifier, it is possible to choose an existing classifier in the same package as the instance.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong><ins>Lifeline</ins></strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Create a classifier from this instance</strong>: Applies the assistant described above to the instance represented by the lifeline. The instance is also created if it does not already exist.</li>
<li><strong>Update instance or part from the classifier</strong>: Applies the assistant described above to the instance represented by the lifeline. The instance is also created if it does not already exist.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong><ins>Message</ins></strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Create an operation from this message</strong>: Creation of an operation from a message. If the class did not already exist, it is also created.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong><ins>Attribute link</ins></strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Create an attribute from this occurrence</strong>: Creation of an attribute from an attribute link. If the class did not already exist, it is also created.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong><ins>Transition</ins></strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Create an operation from this transition</strong>: Creation of an operation from the transition. This assistant can only be used in state diagrams associated with classes.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong><ins>Interface</ins></strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Update classes from this interface</strong>: Updates all classes implementing the interface from the interfaces content.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong><ins>Class</ins></strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Implement Interfaces properties</strong>: Creation of the operations defined in the interfaces that are implemented by the selected class.</li>
<li><strong>Delete Interface properties implementations</strong>:Deletion of the operations defined in the interfaces which are implemented by the selected class.</li>
<li><strong>Update internal structure</strong>: Update of the parts instantiated in the internal structure of the class.</li>
</ul>
