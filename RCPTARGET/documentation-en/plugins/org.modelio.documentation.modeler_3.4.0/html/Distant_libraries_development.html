<p>The development of a remote library is the first phase in the remote library
life cycle, during which a remote library is prepared by a developer for packaging.</p>

<p>Remote library development includes the following operations:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>the UML model must first be built (including any specific code
generation annotations you wish to include)</p></li>
<li><p>the remote library must then be created and defined. This includes
the creation of the future remote library itself (name, description, version
number), as well as the definition of its contents (model parts and external
files) and its dependencies on other remote libraries.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>This section presents how to create and define a remote library.</p>

<p>The first step in the development of a remote library is its creation inside
a UML model.</p>

<p>To create a remote library, follow the steps shown below.</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a new project with a local model named P1 and create some elements into it.</li>
<li>Create a directory named &lsquo;fragModelio&rsquo; in a shared http directory.</li>
<li>Copy the &lsquo;admin&rsquo;, &lsquo;blobs&rsquo; and &lsquo;model&rsquo; directories from &lsquo;data/fragments/P1&rsquo; into &lsquo;fragModelio&rsquo; directory.</li>
<li>From the &lsquo;.runtime\fragments\P1&rsquo; directory, copy the &lsquo;.index&rsquo; directory into &lsquo;fragModelio&rsquo; directory.</li>
<li>In &lsquo;fragModelio&rsquo; directory, rename &lsquo;admin/stamp.dat&rsquo; into &lsquo;admin/stamp.conf&rsquo;.</li>
</ol>

<h4 >Defining model parts to be included in a remote library<a href="#Defining-model-parts-to-be-included-in-a-remote-library" class="wiki-anchor">&para;</a></h4>

<p>Model elements to be included in a remote library are referenced using
manifestation links. These elements will be available for use in projects
where the remote library is deployed. Only high-level packages (packages
located under the project root) can be referenced by a remote library through
a manifestation link. However, all the elements they contain will also be
packaged in the remote library.</p>

<h4 >Modeling dependencies between remote libraries<a href="#Modeling-dependencies-between-remote-libraries" class="wiki-anchor">&para;</a></h4>

<p>If your remote library is dependent on another remote library, this fact
must be modeled through a use link.</p>

<a name="Defining-external-files-to-be-included-in-a-remote-library"></a>
<h4 >Defining external files to be included in a remote library<a href="#Defining-external-files-to-be-included-in-a-remote-library" class="wiki-anchor">&para;</a></h4>

<p>External files can also be included in a remote library. This is useful when
you want your remote library to install specific files like libraries, jar
files or resource files when it&rsquo;s deployed.</p>

<p>For example, let&rsquo;s imagine that you have reversed the Java JDK, in order to
produce a reusable component. This type of remote library, when deployed,
should allow Java application development including compilation, meaning that
JDK jar files would then have to be deployed by the remote library.</p>

<p>When defining external files to be included in a remote library, the
$(GenRoot) variable should be used. This variable is the root directory for
generation, and can be defined by each user at Modelio parameter level, which
means that the external files included in the remote library will be deployed
correctly in each user&rsquo;s own individual environment.</p>
