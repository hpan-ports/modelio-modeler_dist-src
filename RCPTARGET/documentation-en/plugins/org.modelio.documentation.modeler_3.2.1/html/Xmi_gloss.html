<ul>
<li><p><strong>Ecore</strong>: Ecore is the EMF metamodel, almost identical to EMOF
(Essential MOF).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>EMF</strong>: EMF is a modeling and code generation simplification
framework used in the construction of tools and applications based on a data
model structure. EMF provides the basis for interoperability with other tools
or applications based on EMF. EMF-Uml2 is an EMF-based implementation of the
UML2 standard.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>MOF</strong>: Meta-Object Facility (MOF) is a standard created by the OMG
that deals with the representation and use of metamodels.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>OMG</strong>: The Object Management Group (OMG) is an American non-profit-making
association created in 1989, whose aim is to standardize and promote
the object model in all its forms.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>UML</strong>: The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a graphic language used
to model data and processing. The UML is an accomplished and non-proprietary
formalization of object modeling used in software engineering.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>XML</strong>: eXtensible Markup Language (XML) is a generic marker IT
language. Its main objective is to facilitate the automated exchange of
content between heterogeneous information systems (interoperability).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>XMI</strong>: XML Metadata Interchange (XMI) is a standard created by the
OMG for the exchange of UML metadata information based on XML. It is a
procedure for serializing MOF objects, used to describe objects in XML form.</p></li>
