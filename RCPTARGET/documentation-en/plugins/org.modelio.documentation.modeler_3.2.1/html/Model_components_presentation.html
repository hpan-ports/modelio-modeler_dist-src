<p>Model components are independent, identified and coherent parts of a larger
model, packaged into a single file.</p>

<p>Model components can contain the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>stable model extracts</li>
<li>tagged value and note types specific to certain modules</li>
<li>external files</li>
</ul>


<p>Sometimes referred to as RAM components (Reusable Autonomous Model
components), model components are used in a teamwork context, to allow
different developers or development teams working on the same project to work
only on a limited part of the complete project model.</p>

<p>Model components have a <a href="Model_components_lifecycle.html">version number</a>. At regular, identified intervals,
each model component can be repackaged and its version number incremented,
before being delivered to an integration project, where the complete
application will be assembled.</p>

<p>Since it is impossible to completely isolate one part of a development project
from all the others, a model component can depend on another model component.
For further information on model component dependencies, please see &ldquo;<a href="Model_components_lifecycle.html">The life
cycle of a model component</a>&rdquo;.</p>

<p>In a large scale multi-user development project, with several people working
together at the same time and in the same workspace, it can be challenging,
not to say difficult, to efficiently manage all the interactions that take
place.</p>

<p>Model components enable you to increase your efficiency, by reducing the size
of the different model extracts involved in a project, and the number of
people working on any given model part. This means that each development team
can progress in its own teamwork environment and according to its own
schedule, without affecting the work of the other project participants (as
shown below).</p>
