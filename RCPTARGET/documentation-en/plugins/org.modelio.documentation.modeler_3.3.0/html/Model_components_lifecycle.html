<p>The life cycle of a model component can be broken down into four distinct
stages:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The <a href="Model_components_development.html">development phase</a>, during which a model component developer
prepares a model component for packaging. This phase includes the construction
of the UML model, and the creation and definition of the future model
component itself, as well as the modeling of its dependency on other model
components.</p></li>
<li><p>The <a href="Model_components_development.html">packaging phase</a>, during which the model component is
actually produced by a model component developer. This phase sees the
definition of packaging information, and the production of a unique model
component file, suffixed &ldquo;.ramc&rdquo;.</p></li>
<li><p>The <a href="Model_components_deployment.html">deployment phase</a>, during which a model component is deployed
by a user in a user project. If the deployment operation should encounter any
deployment issues, these can be solved here, before re-running the deployment
command.</p></li>
</ol>


<a name="Model-component-versions-and-dependencies-between-model-components"></a>
<h4 >Model component versions and dependencies between model components<a href="#Model-component-versions-and-dependencies-between-model-components" class="wiki-anchor">&para;</a></h4>

<p>When a model component is developed, it is assigned a version number. This
version number can be incremented each time a model component is subsequently
repackaged (either following modifications made to it or when making scheduled
deliveries).</p>

<p>The dependencies that exist between Modelio model components are so-called
strict dependencies. This means that a model component depends on a specific
version of another model component. This version must be respected during
model component deployment in a project.</p>

<p>For example, let&rsquo;s imagine that we have two model components, &ldquo;A&rdquo; and &ldquo;B&rdquo;,
both of which are in version 1.0.0. If version 1.0.0 of the &ldquo;B&rdquo; model
component depends on version 1.0.0 of the &ldquo;A&rdquo; model component, and if the &ldquo;B&rdquo;
model component is to be deployed in a project, the following steps must be
carried out:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Version 1.0.0 of the &ldquo;A&rdquo; model component must first be deployed in
the project.</p></li>
<li><p>Version 1.0.0 of the &ldquo;B&rdquo; model component can then be deployed.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Now let&rsquo;s imagine that the &ldquo;A&rdquo; model component is modified and subsequently
repackaged, with a new version number, 2.0.0. We still want to deploy both the
&ldquo;A&rdquo; and the &ldquo;B&rdquo; model components in our project. The following steps must be
carried out:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>First, the original dependency between the &ldquo;B&rdquo; model component and
version 1.0.0 of the &ldquo;A&rdquo; model component must be deleted.</p></li>
<li><p>Next, a new dependency must be created between the &ldquo;B&rdquo; model
component and version 2.0.0 of the &ldquo;A&rdquo; model component.</p></li>
<li><p>The &ldquo;A&rdquo; model component must then be repackaged, and its version
number incremented.</p></li>
<li><p>Version 2.0.0 of the &ldquo;A&rdquo; model component can now be deployed in a
project, followed by the new version of the &ldquo;B&rdquo; model component.</p></li>
</ul>
