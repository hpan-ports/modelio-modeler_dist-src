/**
 * Interface for complex graphic creation interaction in a diagram. <br>
 * <br>
 * The interaction is started when the user clicks on the button in the diagram palette. Once the interaction is started the user
 * can use the mouse to create a new graphic multi link in the diagram.<br>
 * The {@link #acceptFirstElement(IDiagramHandle, IDiagramGraphic) acceptFirstElement} method is called to know if the element flown
 * over by the mouse is valid to be the first element of the interaction. If it is not valid as first element, then the
 * {@link #acceptLastElement(IDiagramHandle, List, IDiagramGraphic) acceptLastElement} method is called to know if the element flown
 * over by the mouse is valid as last element of the interaction (in which case the interaction is done with a single click, as is
 * the case for IBoxCommand for example). <br>
 * If the element is valid as first element the interaction moves on to the next step. The
 * {@link #acceptAdditionalElement(IDiagramHandle, List, IDiagramGraphic) acceptAdditionalElement} method is called to know if the
 * element flown over by the mouse can be added to the current interaction. If it is not valid to be added to the current
 * interaction, then the {@link #acceptLastElement(IDiagramHandle, List, IDiagramGraphic) acceptLastElement} method is called to
 * know if the element flown over by the mouse is valid as last element of the interaction.<br>
 * When the user clicks on an element for which the {@link #acceptAdditionalElement(IDiagramHandle, List, IDiagramGraphic)
 * acceptAdditionalElement} method doesn't accept the element to be added to the interaction but the
 * {@link #acceptLastElement(IDiagramHandle, List, IDiagramGraphic) acceptLastElement} method accepts the element as last element of
 * the interaction, the {@link #actionPerformed(IDiagramHandle, IDiagramGraphic, List, List, List, Rectangle) actionPerformed}
 * method is called. <br>
 * <br>
 * The {@link #actionPerformed(IDiagramHandle, IDiagramGraphic, List, List, List, Rectangle) actionPerformed} method is in charge of
 * creating the elements in the model and of unmasking them in the diagram.
 * 
 * This interface is intended to be implemented by MDA Components in order to add commands in a diagram palette.
