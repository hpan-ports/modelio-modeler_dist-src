/**
 * Default implementation of a diagram link command.
 * <p>
 * 
 * In a diagram, graphic links are graphic objects that display diagram links. For example an
 * ElementImport is a graphic link. <code>ILinkCommand</code> is the
 * interface that drives the interaction of creating a link
 * <p>
 * 
 * The interaction is started when the user clicks on the button in the diagram palette. Once the interaction is started
 * the user can use the mouse to create a new graphic link in the diagram. The
 * {@link #acceptFirstElement(IDiagramHandle, IDiagramGraphic) acceptFirstElement} method is called to know if the
 * element flown over by the mouse is valid to be the origin of the link. If it is not valid the user cannot click. If
 * the element is valid the interaction moves on to the next step. The
 * {@link #acceptSecondElement(IDiagramHandle, IDiagramGraphic, IDiagramGraphic) acceptSecondElement} is called
 * until the user click on the destination of the link. When the user clicks on the destination the
 * {@link #actionPerformed(IDiagramHandle, IDiagramGraphic, IDiagramGraphic, LinkRouterKind, ILinkPath)
 * actionPerformed} method is called.
 * <p>
 * 
 * The
 * {@link #actionPerformed(IDiagramHandle, IDiagramGraphic, IDiagramGraphic, LinkRouterKind, ILinkPath)
 * actionPerformed} is in charge of creating the link in the model and of unmasking the element in the diagram.<br>
 * 
 * Subclass the DefaultLinkCommand to provide a behavior to the
 * {@link #actionPerformed(IDiagramHandle, IDiagramGraphic, IDiagramGraphic, LinkRouterKind, ILinkPath)
 * actionPerformed} method.
