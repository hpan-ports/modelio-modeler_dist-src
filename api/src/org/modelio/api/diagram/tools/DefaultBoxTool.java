/**
 * Default implementation of a diagram box command.
 * <p>
 * 
 * In a diagram, graphic boxes are graphic objects that display diagram nodes. For example Packages and Classes
 * are graphic boxes. <code>IBoxCommand</code> is the interface that drives the interaction of creating a box
 * <p>
 * 
 * The interaction is started when the user clicks on the button in the diagram palette. Once the interaction is started
 * the user can use the mouse to create a new graphic box in the diagram. The
 * {@link #acceptElement(IDiagramHandle, IDiagramGraphic) acceptElement} method is called to know if the element
 * flown over by the mouse is valid for the command. If it is not valid the user cannot finish the interaction. If the
 * element is valid the user can terminates the interaction by either clicking or by pressing the left mouse button
 * doing a drag and drop and releasing the mouse button. Once this is done the
 * {@link #actionPerformed(IDiagramHandle, IDiagramGraphic, Rectangle) actionPerformed} is called.
 * <p>
 * 
 * The {@link #actionPerformed(IDiagramHandle, IDiagramGraphic, Rectangle) actionPerformed} does nothing in
 * this default implementation.<br>
 * 
 * Subclass the DefaultBoxCommand to provide a behavior to the
 * {@link #actionPerformed(IDiagramHandle, IDiagramGraphic, Rectangle) actionPerformed} method.
